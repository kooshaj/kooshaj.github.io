In other words, we only work with the very best in class. The vision is 'Zero Limits' on client outcomes. As an actively producing advisor myself I am able to model to other financial professionals a way to grow their practices in two distinct ways.  1) we have vast expertise in utilizing digital platforms to operate remotely from a home-based office. 2) we provide a state-of-the-art technology that adds value to clients by eliminating their debt via a world-class solution. Many agents, brokers and advisors have benefitted from offering United Financial Freedom's amazing product, the Money Max Account. Now, full disclosure, I own one and am a happy customer. Because I own my own 'Debt Terminator', I know for a fact that it is the easiest, most modern debt elimination tool in the world and it works! The technology is awesome and based on machine learning. Thank goodness they figured out how to put all those algorithms to work shredding debt for myself and my clients! The reason all of this helps financial services professionals, like myself, is because the web-based system makes specific recommendations to their clients that open up the fast lane for them to get to their debt free day.  Once we are able to get a client out of debt, in as little as 5 to 7 years, with no new loan, we can get to work on building their wealth. That is the real magic in converting debt to wealth. All of my previous experience in business and coaching sports like Track and Football has left me positioned to provide leadership and ideas to other professionals who want to grow their practice and stand out from the competition. I am not a 'life coach' and you do not have to pay me anything for 'coaching'. But I am a Coach.  I can tell you this much for sure though, it feels amazing to be getting families and businesses out of debt faster without changing their budget outflow. But, and this where YOU may come in, I just can't do it all on my own. There are too many people out there who need help or can simply do better. Why pay more interest than you have to? It just doesn't make sense. But there is a solution... If you are coachable let me show you how to provide cutting-edge solutions to your clients, leaving your competition in the dust!

Our services, and products offered by our corporate and strategic partners, provide next level solutions to families, individuals and businesses. We specialize in advanced tax-savings plans for retirement and replacing income for life with properly designed living benefits policies. But our vision and values are more than another insurance company. We are a brand that demands better and delivers it affordably. Forget what you think you know about money, it's probably wrong. The common theme of everything we do at Zero Limit is not accepting 'good enough'. In education, we show families how to remove expectations, instill discipline naturally and have zero limit to family happiness. In insurance, we remove government handcuffs and show regular folks how to afford the 'good stuff'. In medical screening w,e remove limits by providing access to diagnosis that can literally save / extend lives! Zero Limit Group includes approved partner / vendors under each category. Only brands that fit the concept of removing existing limits to success, income, education etc. fit our vision. Our value is that education leads to actionable knowledge, which is power.

The United States Government funded research to map the entire human genome in 2003.  This DNA mapping project, at a cost of $5 billion dollars, has critical public health consequences for individuals and society. •The genome is what all humans have in common at the genetic level, it is your DNA.  •Mutations in the genome are the cause of hereditary cancers such as breast cancer, prostate or pancreatic and five other forms of cancer. •When a mutation is detected in the genome there are solutions provided by medical technology to make it far less likely that cancer will ever actually be developed. •Prediction is the closest thing we currently have to a cure for cancer, it is preventative medicine. It is also a major public health win; the expense of chemotherapy is killing Medicare, due to cost. Preventative medicine is the best hope for preserving Medicare. That is why our government pays for these type of wellness screenings.  AFFA is an organization of Public Health Advocates dedicated to helping Medicare Beneficiaries qualify for Hereditary Cancer Screening at no cost. We seek to work with community partners to facilitate this advocacy. Community partners could include; churches, senior activity centers &amp; other public or private organizations. We provide a no-cost educational presentation in a group setting for our community partners.  Please join with us in this advocacy campaign by talking to an AFFA Advocate about doing a Hereditary Cancer Screening education presentation in your facility today.

","8 - 2018","","","","Freedom Equity Group, LLC. (OFFICIAL)","","National Hiring Manager","Why do 90% of people who enter the insurance industry as licensed agents fail? Part of it is the nature of sales. In any industry, the top ten percent of sales representatives make 90% of the sales. The Elite Digital Division of Freedom Equity Group takes away this problem by providing certified, trained and proven closers that agents can choose to work with to teach clients about avoiding critical wealth killers. The other huge barrier to making it in the life insurance business is not having anyone to talk to. Again, our platform solves this issue for agents by providing live transfers to licensed agents who set up webinars for our Certified Mentors.

","2 - 2018","","","","United Financial Freedom","","Senior Director","So here is a true story that happened on my way to another promotion with United Financial Freedom. My client will get out of debt 15 years sooner in only 3.9 years with the Money Max Account. Call her D.C. in Florida. She is a mom and caretaker of her husband who is on permanent disability.  Imagine her relief to be able to see a pathway to truly being debt free in a much shorter time. After she learned about the program she was excited to see what her savings would be so we booked another meeting. After we established her savings amount and debt free day she was ecstatic!  After the program had already been installed we discussed what could go wrong and how the program could get off track and fail. The first would be not using it but I knew D.C. would be able to use the web based program easily, in fact just about anyone can. Then we discussed what her plan would be if, like her husband, she couldn't work due to illness. This was just before the COVID panic started to settle in... She had no plan.  Most families don't have a plan for what they would do if the income in the household stopped. Our solution for D.C. gave her peace of mind that in the event of a critical or chronic diagnosis her coverage would replace her income for life! The best part was that it came with an asset protection plan that replaced the need to make new contributions to her 401(k). Again, this was just prior to the COVID stock market crash. In review we will get her out of debt in a fraction of the time, insure her income for life in case of disaster and provide principle guaranteed asset accumulation for her retirement. Answering our facebook ad is the best thing she ever did for her finances.  Are you an advisor? Do you want to do this type of work for your clients? Message me for a link to learn more.

I provide a unique understanding, insight and expertise in how to manage risk within the retail industry from both a merchant and solution provider standpoint. There is not a competitive edge to sharing and educating all merchants on best practices and solutions that they can adopt and deploy within their environment to fight and eradicate fraud and loss. For over the last 19 years, I have passionately focused on implementing sound risk solutions, developing end-to-end payment and fraud solutions and protecting a company's data, 'Crown Jewels'​. As an active board member and chair of the Merchant Risk Council, I established and educated retailers in payment fraud best practices. I get no greater satisfaction than being presented with a challenge and creating a long-term solution. I thrive on leveraging the right technology to solve today’s merchant company needs. One of the greatest compliments I’ve been paid is understanding that, 'the company's primary goal is to make money”, thereby affirming my unique approach and commitment to effectively managing risk without sacrificing, or reducing, the customer experience.  As a leader, throughout my various roles up to Vice President, I have successfully supported sales, strategic positioning, new business development, sound risk models and security trust frameworks. I collaborate with Board Directors, C Level and Management teams to deliver quality performance to internal/external customers, develop project teams and improve strategic positioning.

Artificial Intelligence for Wireless Networking' includes sections on: * Fundamentals of AI * User Experience Intelligence * Automated Wireless Network Operation * Active Security Protection * Implementing AI in your Network Although no one can predict what the future might hold, AI is blurring the lines between science fiction and scientific reality.  This book delves into the possibilities of using brain-waves to fine tune the Wi-Fi/5G performance to user's psychological expectations.  The examples in this book will leave your grey cells tickled, building your ability to think the AI-way! Often, AI is viewed as a potential threat to human jobs. To tackle this uncomfortable zone, I also address possible collaboration options with various AI Systems and the skills that will keep you relevant and in demand.  This book will inspire, educate, and challenge you to use artificial intelligence not just for wireless networks but well beyond. This book is useful for anyone who wants to learn about AI or is looking to solve problems in the field of wireless networking.

","1 - 2018","","","","RTLS for Dummies","","Author","Author of Book RTLS For Dummies. Published by Wiley Publishing, Inc.  This book gives you the whole RTLS story, from soup to nuts, in the easy to understand For Dummies format. I begin with a tour of the RTLS applications and then serve you the details of what goes into an RTLS and what the various RTLS technologies are. Then, I plunge into the practical things that you need to consider before installing an RTLS and the common pitfalls that you need to be aware of. I include a chapter on evaluating an RTLS solution or selecting an RTLS vendor. And because RTLS security is equally as important as its accuracy, I also include a chapter on possible RTLS hacks and attacks. After reading this book, you’ll know what an RTLS is, how an RTLS is achieved, how to choose the right RTLS technology, and how you can make an RTLS work for you. Like other For Dummies books, this one’s been designed to let you skip around as much as possible. If you don’t want to read this book cover to cover, you don’t have to. Your current knowledge or experience of an RTLS makes some topics more relevant than others. If you want to zero-in on a particular topic, you can use the Table of Contents and index to focus on that coverage.

We work with some of the largest Mortgage Banking firms in the U.S and partner with most of the Blue Chip CRM's in the marketplace today providing both Data Intelligence and Automation. We use hundreds of data points to identify which customer is in the best position to take advantage of the current market and/or personal situation in order to put them into the most optimal mortgage product. Simply put, lenders no longer have to “sell”, they just present the best options to their customers and allow them to choose the one that is most beneficial. We are considered the leaders in our space, and we’re growing incredibly fast. In fact we’ve tripled in size since the start of the year. We play ping-pong, listen to music, watch videos, have contests, go on boat rides, celebrate wins, celebrate each other, support one another, push one another, and expect everyone to play their role to the best of their abilities at all times.

Motivation determines what you do. Attitude determines how well you do it.❞ - Lou Holtz I feel that this quote defines my leadership style and approach to every opportunity. I am an executive who excels at leading organizations to make customers the #1 focus of their operations, leading to double digit growth, higher customer retention, and increased share of wallet.  I gravitate toward disruptive and emerging strategies, products, and services geared towards enhanced convenience and improved customer experience. I am also strategic, always looking for what's next to facilitate stronger business results and profitable growth. Leaders should be accountable for outcomes. Empowerment with accountability drives focus, minimizes distractions, and provides line of sight to priorities and expectations. When it comes to solving problems, I am a firm believer in addressing the root cause, rather than treating symptoms. This builds a foundation for future success and unearths new business opportunities.  My skills and interests can be successfully applied to leadership roles in: ‣ Customer Experience, Lifecycle, Loyalty, and Retention ‣ Business Unit Management, Revenue Growth, and Business Development ‣ Operational Excellence and Strategic Program Management A few of my core beliefs and values include: ★Keep the Focus on the Customer★ Customer interactions and relationships are opportunities to enhance satisfaction, build loyalty, maximize revenue, and can often serve as springboards to launch new growth initiatives. ★Relentlessly Innovate and Embrace Change★ Business breakthroughs and enhancements to customer experience come from listening and experimenting with new options, iterating improvements rapidly, and influencing the organization to embrace agility and flexibility. ★Approach Problem Solving Strategically★  Effective leaders have the vision to create a strategic direction combined with the ability to understand intuitively what needs to be done operationally. Question, analyze, and understand business dynamics quickly to arrive at an effective plan to drive results. ★Communicate and Collaborate★  It is critical that leaders build strong partnerships with customers, vendors, business partners, and other stakeholders. This allows them to build productive cross-functional teams, recognizing that each part of the organization has a part to play in the customer experience.","2017","Vice President - Customer Experience ","Western Union","https://www.linkedin.com/company/2019","https://www.westernunion.com"," "," "," "," ","Miami-Fort Lauderdale Area","Financial Services","🦆-default-invited"," ","","Leadership","Customer Experience","Establishing Strategic Partnerships","Change Management","Strategy","Risk Management","Financial Services","Strategic Planning","Operations Management","Business Analysis","Business Planning","Business Development","Project Management","Business Strategy","Budgets","Product Marketing","Vendor Management","CRM","Marketing","Marketing Management","Business Process Improvement","Competitive Analysis","Sales","Forecasting","B2B","Project Portfolio Management","Financial Analysis","Banking","Finance","Retail","Outsourcing","Credit","Financial Forecasting","Analytical Skills","Payments","Executive Management","Cross-functional Team Leadership","Management","Negotiation","Team Building","Contract Negotiation","Design Thinking","Problem Solving","Strategic Partnerships","Payment Services","Customer Experience Management","Customer Driven Innovation","Business Innovation","Disruptive Technologies","Customer Retention","Western Union","","Vice President - Customer Experience ","In my role as Vice President of Customer Experience: Value Streams, I champion the voice of the customer for Western Union: • Created a global Culture of Customer, moving operations from transaction-centric to Customer-centric.   • Collaborated to drive innovative e-commerce products and processes to attract new customers, create loyalty, enabling repeat Customer activity.   • Chartered as executive champion for Customer-first initiatives, including development, implementation of new contact center KPI standards, standard work, service levels and balancing internal vs outsourced staffing.  • Collaborated with site leaders to develop best in class hiring and workforce planning to support team alignment,  • Evaluated external partners to supplement internal experience teams  • Inspired, developed and owned data-based Customer KPIs, aligned to business objectives to drive resource decisions, AHT, NPS, CSAT for e-commerce and retail channel objectives.   • Leveraged friction insights to determine Customer and brand risk and prioritize resources. • Integral to the development and implementation of self-service tools to improve CX, leveraging continuous process, UX and system improvement (Agile methodology)","2017","","","","Western Union","","Vice President & General Manager","Driven business development executive with responsibility for WU’s operations across Central America and the Caribbean.

AI-Reserve extends Git workflows and creates a continuous delivery pipeline using AzureML and automatically triggers build, test and deployment processes. AI-Reserve is backed by a powerful 'Experiment Engine,' a library that lets users define their machine learning workflow once, and execute it many times in a parameterized, portable fashion.  The Experiment Engine supports workflows such as training and deploying of models, performing model selection over a range of models and parameters, and fanning out model deployment to several endpoints. The Experiment Engine uses Azure Machine Learning service on the back-end for tracking experiments, registering models, performing vulnerability analysis, and creating web service deployments. Training is supported for local Python scripts, remote Python scripts on AzureML compute cluster, and DBC Notebooks on Azure Databricks cluster. Models are deployed as Docker containers, using base images one can customize. Supported deployment targets include Azure Container Instances and Azure Kubernetes Service. Machine learning workflows are captured in configuration JSON files in which one defines compute resources, training runs and their parameters, models and their metrics, and web service deployments. Configuration JSON files are translated into scaffolding Python scripts that glues together the blocks of execution, such as resource allocation, model selection, and model deployment. The resulting structure is run/executed and orchestrated under the control of the Experiment Engine to users’ specifications.","12 - 2017","12 - 2017","","","Conduent","","Data Science Group Manager for Healthcare Analytics - GHS (Government Healthcare Solutions)","Conduent (NYSE: CNDT) issued an IPO on January 3, 2017 as a spin-off of Xerox HRS from Xerox Corporation (NYSE: XRX).

He designed the framework and is actively involved in its implementation. The main requirements were to build a system that will be up 24/7, permit seamless extension, and live maintenance (e.g.: the framework should never be brought down for patches). This framework lets individuals across the company add new functionalities to it through the implementation of extensible interfaces (custom analyzers) and dynamic linking. The results of the custom analyzers are routed to the scoring engine mentioned below for advanced statistical analysis. This framework provides engineers with tools to measure the confidence and reliability in data. It is a surface that bridges the gap between the raw data Microsoft collects from billions of machines worldwide and advanced mathematics needed to derive insights from that data. The goal is to enable engineers to leverage advanced and matured mathematics from fields like Information theory, evolutionary dynamics, etc., without having to deal with the complexity of the required science. Dr. Anyouzoa led the analytic effort to close the applications gap between the Android ecosystem and the Windows ecosystem. Dr. Anyouzoa used Homogeneity Analysis (Multiple Correspondence Analysis) and Bayes Inference on Android features and capabilities to craft the fastest and most effective path for Microsoft to close the applications gap in the apps war against Google. Dr. Anyouzoa designed and implemented a video streaming (image) regression analysis tool to monitor the video quality of Android on Windows throughout the development process. This tool was also used in a project to stream Xbox video games from data centers on the west and east coasts.

Another part of his role is to teach and encourage others to learn new ways to look at data, and push the envelope to help Microsoft get and keep a competitive edge in data science. Dr. Anyouzoa has developed the Scoring Engine technology to evaluate the quality of the Windows OS. This technology is deployed in Windows Telemetry to monitor data quality in the Windows wide ecosystem. A paper titled: 'Statistical Regression Analysis using Local Dynamics' describing Dr. Anyouzoa's work on the scoring engine has received a 5 stars (out of 5) @ ThinkWeek 2013 under the category 'Open Call' for contributions that are so unique or disruptive that they do not logically fall within a pre-defined topic area.

Dr. Anyouzoa is in charge of all the mathematics used in the Scoring Engine, a Performance Analysis System that protects the Windows Operating System from regressing.  This role involves constantly revisiting the maths being used and propose innovative solutions to protect an ever-evolving OS.  Dr. Anyouzoa has designed and implemented an entropy-based variability allocation system that, in face of variability in systems (machines, code-flows) response, would detect the source of variability in the data stream (machines, code-flow, combination machine\code-flow or other factors). This is a powerful tool used to go after regressions in the windows based systems and scenarios. Dr. Anyouzoa has designed and implemented a scoring engine to guard the Windows OS against regressions, using Tensors Physics and techniques from Neuroscience. The scoring engine is at the heart of monitoring code flow to prevent code churn from regressing the Windows OS, ultimately preventing such regressions to land into a customers’ computers. A key pillar for shipping cleaner and faster Windows Operating Systems. Dr. Anyouzoa has designed and implemented a C++ based test framework that is being used to progressively phase out the current Jscript based test framework utilized to test Windows servers.

I am incredibly adept at helping organizations to modernize their digital infrastructure. In most of my roles and engagements, I have had to build a strategy, engage the business, and communicate the ROI story to senior leadership.

Very excited about what lies ahead. I've primarily consulted and worked on 100+ projects with large companies, most at Fortune 50.   Areas include: - Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning - Data Strategy - Business Process Management & Architecture - Business Strategy All this experience comes together as follows:  'I help companies formulate their data strategy to apply AI/ML techniques, in the context of their business processes, ensuring architectural robustness, so they can execute their business strategy to digitally transform themselves to meet their current and future customer's needs.' In simpler terms, I help solve big business problems by simplifying complexity, so customers can have great experiences.  I am an engineer, architect, designer, scientist, programmer, business owner, mentor, advisor, data scientist, evangelist, storyteller, dreamer, teacher, speaker, writer, doodler, video creator, father, husband, and probably a few more. I think about the big picture in solving those problems considering things like your business ecosystem, your strategy and the choices you have to make, your capabilities, your people, your processes, and your organization. I help to answer questions like what's your current state, what's target, what do you have to do, how quickly can you get there, how does technology fit in that architecture, how does AI fit in there, how can you get jump-started by leveraging what's out there, how can you make data-driven decisions, how to roadmap and implement your plan. I believe in simplifying complexity, adapting, fast action, and delivering results.

Uber, Netflix, etc.), demanding customers (who expect the same kind of experience from their staid insurance company as they do from Amazon), and the availability of a global workforce (eg. remote workers who can add value from anywhere.). With this many things going on, how can executives and business leaders really understand these holistically so they can make smart decisions? One option is to have some kind of a framework that puts things in context - a framework that is easy to visualize and understand. My role is to help clients create and manage this complexity for better decision making.

However I realize that today education is much more expensive, and students come out of college with a huge financial burden that many spend years paying off.  While I do have to teach in a college or university for the student to get credit towards a degree, I try to help students acquire some of the business and work skills that'll help them become successful in their professional endeavors.  Today's students will be tomorrow's business leaders.  I love to teach enthusiastic students who want to learn. This is primarily my way of giving back.

They have many different departments or functional areas, and the department heads have the power and influence to buy tools that are appropriate for their own work. Little if any, consideration is given to the overall objective of the organization. As a result, many of the big organizations end up with a plethora of tools and processes. In this particular case, I worked with the Texas Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to help integrate their over 1200 different tools. This role required business smarts to navigate the politics perspectives, and egos, and also required technical acumen to understand the functionality of different systems, and how they eventually have to work together to deliver value to the citizens of the State of Texas.  Once that's understood, I worked with many teams to architect the future state of the HHS make presentations to executives who had the charge and obligation to make effective and strategic decisions, based on my models and recommendations. Obviously, there was a lot to do and in  one year I could not integrate the whole organization, but made very good progress.","2006","2006","","","St. Edward's University","","Adjunct Professor","Again, teaching students at any opportunity I can get.

Having developed the platform and software, now was the time to test it out by (1) building applications on top of the platform, and, (2) customizing the deployment to clients.  In this capacity, my team moved from working on the foundations, to developing a Lead-Management application (much similar to SalesForce before it's time).  Simultaneously I was also head of the Processional Services Team whose responsibility was to connect with customers and support the field engineers who were doing installations or support. This experience was also fabulous because it gave me a sense of what the customer needs and constraints were. I often had to make executive decisions on the spot under pressure and the implications of those decisions could mean taking away resources from one area to focus on another.  The direct interaction with customers also helped me understand their positions and perspectives.  This often resulted in changes to the core platform and the applications sitting on top of the platform.  Our customers were worldwide. ","4 - 1999","9 - 2004","","","Exterprise, Inc","","Director of Engineering","This was a very exciting time of my professional career.  Here's where I learned and practice the art of designing large scale, robust, distributed, intelligent, flexible software systems for the enterprise.  This was the time the software methodologies and the internet as a tool to be leveraged by businesses was maturing at a rapid pace.  A lot of companies started on a dime - creating application specific software such as lead management, people management, inventory management, product management, etc. Many of these applications had many parts in common - such as a similarly structured database (though the content will be different), similar foundation for user interfaces (though the look and feel could be different), similar mechanisms to run processes (though the process logic is different depending upon the specific process), similar administration needs with security and access control, among others. So our idea (the company founders' really) was to develop a platform on which one could build different applications that could leverage such common functionality.  This was similar to today's application services (like IBM WebSphere), but much more enhanced to include the end-to-end environment within it.  Here I learned many of the architectural principles and techniques that'll come in handy later both in the technical and business context.  I headed a team creative and smart developers, and my team was responsible to provide a customized user interaction for each user each time they access the system. Content relevant to the customer's context at that moment is what we did. This meant that the same customer will likely have different experiences every time they access the system functionality.  None of this could be 'hard coded' because that becomes infeasible to program.   The foundation of such flexibility was in the underlying Agent-based intelligent system.","1999","2002","","","Trilogy Software","","Modeling Engineer","When you go online to configure a car or a computer, there is a system behind the screen that is making some decisions based on the choices you make. For example, if you select a certain body frame, it constraints the engine capacity. Such a system has two parts - a core platform that manages models and specific rules that have to be modeled.  The rules are specific to the domain, and will be different when you configure cars versus configuring computers.  I worked as a consultant, modeling the constraints in the configuration systems behind the UI.  I had to understand the clients domain deep enough so they can be modeled correctly. Once the model is build, then a rules engine takes the customer's inputs as they are configuring the part they are interested in, and prunes the trees to eliminate impossible choices.","3 - 1998","4 - 1999","","","KLA-Tencor","","Senior Computer Vision Research Scientist","Designed and developed defect detection algorithms for semiconductor wafers - in the image and the laser domains.

If you are trying to sell me something -- like, I don't know, *data services* as a wildly random example -- you need to say why your business is better than all of your competitors in some important way using an objective, third-party evaluation.   Data Scientist (n.): Person who is better at statistics than any software engineer and better at software engineering than any statistician. — Josh Wills (@josh_wills) May 3, 2012 I am a data scientist with particular interest in natural language processing and conversational AI.  My training is both academic and industrial.  I earned a PhD in computer science using ontologies and machine learning to extract information from noisy text, and an MS in CS working on statistical natural language generation.  I have done over a decade of production-level software engineering in several industries.   While I am a data scientist, I prefer to specialize in one area within AI.  I have been doing data science since before the term was coined.  I have been training supervised machine learning models since the late 1990's and designing and developing information extraction algorithm for nearly as long.  What I focus on now is developing search and conversational AI systems (a.k.a. chatbots and Intelligent Virtual Assistants) using knowledge graphs, IE, ML, and AI.  This is the next great frontier for business efficiency and automation.  It will require more than a chat interface to a database to do it right.   Regarding soft skills, I have done some management and would like to do more, though my style is heavy on typing and light on speaking.   If you would like to better understand what data science is, please consider what Justin Megahan has written here:   https://mixpanel.com/blog/2016/03/30/this-is-the-difference-between-statistics-and-data-science/ If you have not yet successfully hired and supported a data scientist but think you might want to, please consider what Talia Borodin has succinctly written here:   https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/310505   Having worked as a data scientist in a wide variety of companies, I agree.

Code enabled exploration of the possible correlation between user dwell time on eBay item-for-sale listing pages with downstream behavioral data (conversion events).  In other words, I used the length of time a user views an item listing page ('view item page') to determine the likelihood the user will make a purchase or do some other positive action in connection with the item viewed.  Explored additional features available in the web logs in connection with the search engine to further refine the analysis.  Discovered and filtered auto-generated events found in the server-side session logs that others had over-looked and that significantly cleaned up the dwell time analysis.  This exploration and analysis will impact a number of projects at eBay that use item click data in search engine result pages as a proxy for user interest.  Analysis was done on eBay's large server-side Web log collection using Java code run in a Hadoop MapReduce framework on a 1K-node cluster.

I am open to interesting ideas and out-of-the-box thinking though literally all the time. I do not possess an off switch whatever that really means. I do not like talking about myself or MBA style thinking and personal brand (everything this is about). Do not take this page seriously at the moment. It is just a reflection of some of the weird places I've been (and trying to make some of the inauthentic people I've known comfortable). I'm just trying to help people, get one up on Wall Street but not the universe or other people. You do not need to cringe or feel embarrassed, it's okay if you already have I totally get it. And you likely will as you read this page I'm sorry about that if it's uncomfortable. Do not hesitate to reach out to me to learn more about what's going on at the moment and how/if we can be mutually beneficial or make something happen and see if we're a good fit. This is not a good representation of who I am. Sorry for the run-on sentences.   Primary experience with State Street Bank (coop), Brown Brothers Harriman (coop), Tip O'Neill & Associates Lobbying and Public Relations Firm (Reported to Tom O'Neill III), Public Policy & Political Consulting, and Pricewaterhouse Coopers (coop).  I'm completing a Master's degree Graduate Certificate in Business Administration MSA-Tax, MSA- Audit, & Accountancy & have been managing a small capital fund & performing independent consulting in my hometown performing municipal audits, political consulting, digital marketing, etc. I have an insatiable thirst to learn and first fell in love with the financial capital markets in just elementary school. I would graph Rite Aid and other small-cap stocks out of the newspaper. I never knew it made money.  I believe in integrating interdisciplinary concepts in means that do not appear to many. I'm interested in long-term future opportunities in Private Equity and Venture Capital but not exclusively. Sustainable Impact Funds, ESG Consulting Firms, Socially Responsible Investment Funds, and International Development. I am actively working to establish myself in an operations role. I am currently refining Tax expertise and pursuing a Master Tax Advisor designation as an Enrolled  Agent with the IRS and as a CPA. I believe every professional, if possible, should be intimately aware of the tax code and that for me it is a playful, interesting pass-time that pays dividends.

I am always seeking opportunities to better myself and qualify for the challenges of the future. I am currently working on my public speaking and communication skills.

For instance, the traditional retail industry is disappearing and transferring from offline to online with an unprecedented speed. With digitalization, data are all over the corners. Under this circumstance, applying efficient and effective ways to deal with data becomes more and more urgent for companies.  As a business analysis professional, I’ve been learning knowledge and techniques to prepare for post-pandemic challenges. I have experience in data collection, data wrangling, data analysis and data visualization. More importantly, my business background enables me to better understand financial reports and execute market analysis and financial analysis. I can work in a fast-paced environment, meet deadlines, and perform at high standards with limited supervision and handle multiple projects simultaneously. I’m a driven problem-solver who embraces change as exciting challenges for learning and growth. Now, I put my analysis skills to work as a business analyst in an investment bank. Shouldering the responsibility to finish a project with a team of five, I adhere to all the deadlines and go beyond by seeing all kinds of research reports and collecting and cleaning data to analyze.  Whether you need someone for a short-term project or a long-term collaboration, I’d love to hear from you. You’re invited to explore my work and contact me so we can discuss how we can embrace new challenges together.

I had designed several new marketing products to assist schools in their communication and future planning strategies.

As I run, my mind often wanders and I find myself mesmerized in a state crafted by my very own conscience. I think about absolutely everything one can think about and before I know it, end up watching several mental films about my very unpredictable future. Being quite the over-thinker, I’ve recently realized that these visions are nothing more than my mind well... overthinking. Because, for many people, including myself, the future is quite unclear; and for most, this uncertainty is very uncomfortable. However, there does happen to be a very small percentage of people out there for whom this uncertainty is nothing more than a source of motivation — a drive to excel and to ensure the likelihood of success, if you will. I am one of those people.  Hi! My name is Wasay Noor; I am an undergraduate at the University of California, Santa Barbara and I hope to be a great fit for you! At UCSB, I am majoring in Economics & Accounting and working towards a minor in Statistical Science, all while completing multiple Finance and Investing courses online. Professionally, I am extremely interested in pursuing Investment Banking and Corporate Finance. Outside of my academic life, I enjoy actively volunteering and giving back to the community, listening to podcasts, and getting in as many weekly miles as possible, as I’m an avid runner! Ultimately, what differentiates me from most others is not the fact that I have my whole future all figured out. On the contrary, I too, foresee much uncertainty in regards to where my current path will take me. However, despite this, there is one thing that I am more than certain about: that regardless of my destination, my journey will be filled with organization, diligence, prudence, and perfectionism.","2021","KIC National Finalist (U.S. Top 4)","KPMG Ideation Challenge - 'Cycle' Team Leader","https://www.linkedin.com/company/2525300","http://www.kpmg.com"," "," "," "," ","New York City Metropolitan Area","Investment Banking","🦆-default-invited"," ","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","KPMG Ideation Challenge - 'Cycle' Team Leader","","KIC National Finalist (U.S. Top 4)","• Team Leader and Financial Analyst for a KPMG Ideation Challenge U.S. Top 4 National team","1 - 2021","","","","Google Online Marketing Challenge","","Team Member, Data Analyst","Partner with a nonprofit and utilize a $10,000 USD monthly budget to develop an online marketing strategy, execute optimized ad campaigns, construct thorough campaign reports, and provide regular data analyses based on the nonprofit’s goals and performance.","1 - 2021","","","","naleu","","FinTech Business Development Intern","naleu [nah • loo] provides working capital to under-served business communities across a variety of industries, striving to empower small businesses by revolutionizing the lending industry with its focus on tech innovation, authenticity, and transparency.","11 - 2020","","","","KPMG Ideation Challenge","","KIC National Semi-Finalist (U.S. Top 20)","• Supervised project development, organized team meetings, administered research &amp; strategy • Analyzed chosen industry's cash flow and financials before and after pandemic  • Calculated proposal financial feasibility &amp; benefit, estimated impact, generated projections","12 - 2020","1 - 2021","","","KPMG Ideation Challenge","","KIC Regional Champion (University Winner)","• Integrated machine learning API technology into pandemic-impacted industries","11 - 2020","12 - 2020","","","J.P.

After 10 years working at lab benches, I have zoomed out to work in the biomedical innovation and investment spaces, with the goals of educating all types of innovators, creating partnerships between academia and industry, and leveraging entrepreneurial energy into tangible, valuable outcomes. I created my online presence, The Sociable Scientist, to indulge my passion for involving non-scientists in conversations surrounding the latest and greatest research insights. I truly believe that the most impactful advances result from the engagement of diverse groups of people, and I want to empower and inform everyone.  My thesis research centered on the rational and creative design of biologically-inspired nanomaterials to redirect immune cells to ameliorate various disease states. Using fundamental engineering principles and immunological insights, we demonstrated efficacy in applications including vaccines, anti-parasitic therapies, genetic manipulation, and food allergy. Outside of the lab, I enjoy organizing and mobilizing people in the context of financial literacy, physical fitness, nutrition, and leadership development with the goal of helping myself and others achieve optimal health, productivity, and happiness.

I am a recent graduate of Belmont University, where I studied entrepreneurship. During my time there, I worked with dozens of startups from the seed stage beyond early growth and acquisition. I became interested in how the dynamics of these different teams worked for and against their goals. I took this interest and began conducting research in organizational psychology, where I studied the impacts of in-group social identity maintenance on group decision making. I am currently applying to graduate programs that will give me an opportunity to discover, develop, and apply data-driven practices for how people and organizations can best work together and achieve their goals in the workplace. In the meantime, I further improving my data science and analytics skills through real-world application. Courage, kindness, and respect are at the heart of everything I do in work and life. I am motivated by achievement and self-development, and I work best in an innovative environment with people that empower me to take risks, learn new skills, and go beyond my comfort zone.

After connecting with an acquaintance in the property management space, I developed and executed business strategies, focused on acquiring and modernizing hotel properties to maximize revenue and profit growth. Over the course of 7 years, I acquired 5 properties, including well-known brands such as the Comfort Inn, Quality Inn, and Red Roof Inn, managed 6 Hotel Managers, and indirectly supervising between 20-40 staff across each site. ▶️ HOW I USED DATA TO POWER BUSINESS I tapped into my programming and data science background to create predictive models that estimated ADR and revPAR rates, tracked hotel performance across occupancy levels, and yielded insights that significantly improved the customer experience. Using these insights, I coached Hotel Managers on how to use the modeling systems to measure growth and profitability, create performance improvement plans, and define and execute 3- and 5-year business plans in alignment with revenue objectives. Additionally, I worked with the Managers on initiating contact and partnerships with local businesses, including restaurants, shops, yoga studios, and sports arenas to create package plans that expanded market share. 📈 Raised $8M in private equity funds to modernize hotel sites every 3-5 years 📈 Drove a 50% EBITDA increase between the third and fourth year at each property In 2015, I was ready to pivot to a new field and play at another level—dentistry. ","5 - 2008","11 - 2015","","","Zivek.com","","Data Finance Analyst | VBA Coder ","▶️ HOW I USED DATA TO POWER BUSINESS One of my major contributions was pioneering a model-based marketing system, combining Excel VBA, Access, and classification models, to strategically identify what, when, and where to market. This system delivered notable results and several success stories that varied from growing the patient base, reducing attrition rates, and building business value by honing in on target markets and accelerating YOY revenues. Here’s a few of my favorites: 📈 Business Development | Grew Zivek to $30M in ad revenues A key factor in growing and scaling the business was creating and selling a series of business coaching plans, modules and comprehensive training systems to improve patient awareness, practice management, and conversion rates through analytics. 📈 Revenue Management | Cut new patient acquisition costs 56% By creating patient profiles to target and narrow the base, our clients were able to understand their target market, including their interests, type of vehicle, and age of home, to personalize their marketing and weed out unlikely prospects. For example, one clinic optimized their conversion rates after the model revealed that patients living in newly renovated homes and/or households with 3+ bedrooms were more likely to pursue elective procedures. 📈 Talent Development | Built and mentored an 8-member geographically-dispersed team I trained my team in best practices for optimizing practice dashboard analytics to convert data into meaningful visualizations, assess KPIs, and brainstorm new ways to achieve goals.","1 - 2011","1 - 2015","","","REI","","Data-Financial Analyst | Marketing Analyst | Online Performance Analyst ","As an Online Performance Analyst and Data Scientist at REI, I applied my innate curiosity and knowledge of analytics and modeling to torture unknown (and unexpected) answers from large data sets. Merging my quantitative research, data analysis, and programming skills, I led the development and continuous improvement of data-driven solutions that identified core business drivers and maximized sales and marketing ROI across customer channels. ▶️ HOW I USED DATA TO POWER BUSINESS I built multiple machine learning algorithms, using KNN, cluster customer analyses, and recommender system techniques to create 8 different customer profile types. These profiles ranged from weekend warriors and busy moms to active senior citizens. I trained these models to aggregate, filter, and extract data and display recommendations for specific retail items, upgrades, and add-ons, based on customer profile, effectively increasing average online order values. Additionally, the systems that I built were adopted for maximizing online sales, customer segmentation, and marketing strategies, specifically—boosting the open and read ratios for direct mail, email marketing, and social media channels. The machine learning and modeling skills that I acquired through my corporate finance and marketing experiences would go on to serve me well in my entrepreneurial endeavors as a Portfolio Manager for private equity and hedge fund assets. ","11 - 2010","11 - 2011","","","Microsoft","","Finance & Senior Marketing Analyst III | Drove marketing ROI through data analytics & models ","I joined Microsoft in 2008, taking on a dual role as a Senior Marketing Analyst and Data Scientist. The financial modeling, machine learning, and quantitative analysis skills that I honed at Chase Bank supported me in researching, developing, testing, and evaluating different Microsoft AI scenarios, using ML models. These models were primarily used by Bing’s marketing teams to better understand (and predict) customer behavior, increase both reliability and relevance of search results, and drive increases in advertising revenues and conversion rates. ▶️ HOW I USED DATA TO POWER BUSINESS I used a variety of ML models, including natural language processing, multi-modal representation, recommender systems, and predictive analytics, and created and trained several standard models to analyze large customer data sets. Through this information, I created and enhanced a predictive model that effectively quantified the buyer journey, from the initial research stage to the point of purchase. By analyzing and interpreting the model outputs, I prepared and presented a business case to our advertising partners, which revealed untapped revenue potential with 18% of customers who would convert early in the buying cycle. This case effectively persuaded Bing’s advertising partners to position their brand at the beginning of the buyer cycle for greater ROI, rather than waiting towards the end to bid on hyper-specific keyword searches, boosting click-thru rates and delivering: 📈 Enhanced brand recognition with 6-7x more exposure in the buy cycle 📈 Average 25% increase in advertiser spend for broader-based keywords 📈 Observable 30% increase in the frequency of ad campaigns This approach catalyzed a shift in advertiser spend behavior, with a focus towards investing in longer-term campaigns and taking a more strategic marketing approach that began with the end result in mind.

During this time, I worked with Relationship Managers, Loan Syndicates, Credit Risk Partners, and other senior stakeholders on developing risk management strategies in the credit and loan approval processes using models. ▶️ HOW I USED DATA TO POWER BUSINESS My efforts were focused on developing, implementing, and continuously improving quantitative risk models for multiple lines of business throughout the bank. I built and ran multiple models, which evaluated probability of portfolio and loan-level default, exposure at default, and loss given defaults. By modeling extensive credit data and risk metrics, I was able to identify trends, potential red flags, and other early warning signs of overdue loans and covenant violations that supported senior management in credit risk decision-making processes.","2 - 2005","12 - 2007","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Washington","Bachelor of Arts (BA), Business Administration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",

The facility was considered the gold standard of compliance and the dispensary utilized a farmer’s market model for distribution which brought cultivators directly to patients in order to make safe-access affordable. William’s ability to cultivate government relations around cannabis advocacy led to his participation in several regulatory framework committees involved in public policy throughout the state of California. William is actively involved in several campaign fundraising committees, Chamber of Commerces, and civil cases involving advocacy for cannabis legalization. William has helped numerous startup groups come into compliance. William studied math and economics at University of California, Santa Cruz and most recently completed a graduate program in Applied Economics and Finance. His graduate study capstone involved research on how financial markets interact using modern microeconomic models in firm theory.

While the formal structure is defined by the company’s leadership, the informal structure naturally emerges as a result of daily interactions between people.  The formal structure is how relationships 'should' work and the informal structure is how they actually do. The informal structure and mechanics are almost always a mystery to organizational leaders.  This knowledge gap leads to poor decision-making that can breed misalignment, disengagement, and counter-productive behavior among employees. Kojuba provides a data-driven framework for leaders to identify and understand the internal social mechanics of their organization.

This empowers the precise estimation of traffic, congestion, and rail-flow capacity at any location in the rail network and at any point in time.

Whether it's building forecasting models to predict outcomes (credit, lending, etc.) or designing and initiating tech product research road maps to identify features and market entry points, I enjoy discovering the best strategy for deployment. I specialize in data science and predictive analytics, business intelligence and data visualization, and UX research and product strategy. All require the same skill set of reducing problems to their essence and building the right solution with a team of other creative thinkers. Many companies build successful products and business lines. It's those that know why and how they got there that will continue to innovate, grow, and succeed. I help make that possible.","2021","Head of Data & Analytics","Till","https://www.linkedin.com/company/11468182","https://hellotill.com","joseph.p.shadel@gmail.com"," "," "," ","Washington, District of Columbia, United States","Venture Capital & Private Equity","🦆-default-invited"," ","","Research","Public Speaking","Community Outreach","Microsoft Office","Fundraising","Data Analysis","Financial Analysis","Economics","R","Social Media","Event Planning","Public Policy","Stata","SQL","Volunteer Management","Non-profits","Editing","Political Science","Nonprofits","Predictive Analytics","Data Visualization","Microsoft Power BI","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Till","","Head of Data & Analytics","","1 - 2021","","","","Till, Inc.","","Product Manager","","12 - 2019","1 - 2021","","","Till, Inc.","","Senior Credit Analyst","","9 - 2019","12 - 2019","","","Breakout Capital, LLC","","Head Of Analytics","I started with Breakout Capital as the first BI Analyst in the company. I worked side-by-side with the Chief Credit Officer to build the company's core credit underwriting model to predict the good/bad outcome of each loan application and developed it into a loan pricing model. I adopted Microsoft Power BI as the company's business intelligence platform to automate regularly recurring reports related to loan origination, portfolio management, and sales performance. Through the business insights these reports provided, we improved the credit policy by both performance and efficiency and better allocated the sales efforts to better performing partners. I also worked closely with the CFO to develop investor reporting, financial cash flow projections, and debt facility monitoring. I added a junior BA to the team partway through my tenure and managed the analytics in-take process, load management, and quality control of our two-person team. As a side project within the company, I helped launch HatchB, an accelerator and tech lab within Breakout Capital, co-leading product research teams in human-centered and empathy-driven product design in addition to building and experimenting product prototypes to fit customer needs.","2 - 2019","9 - 2019","","","Breakout Capital, LLC","","Sr. Business Intelligence Analyst","","2 - 2018","2 - 2019","","","Breakout Capital, LLC","","Business Intelligence Analyst","","5 - 2017","2 - 2018","","","Federal Reserve Board","","Senior Research Assistant in Monetary Affairs","I was part of the Financial Intermediaries Analysis group with the Monetary Affairs Division of the FRB.
